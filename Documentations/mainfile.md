The main code creates a simple GUI using the PyQt5 library. The code first imports the necessary modules, including `QApplication` from `PyQt5. QtWidgets` and `HomePage` from the `home` module.

Next, the code creates a `QApplication` object. This object is responsible for managing the main event loop of the application. It also provides methods for creating and managing windows and other GUI elements.

The code then creates a `HomePage` object. This object represents the main window of the application. The code calls the `show()` method on the `HomePage` object to display it to the user.

Finally, the code calls the `exec_()` method on the `QApplication` object. This method starts the main event loop of the application. The event loop will continue to run until the user closes the application.

**Example usage:**

```python
from simple_gui import MainWindow

if __name__ == "__main__":
  app = QApplication([])
  window = MainWindow()
  window.show()
  app.exec_()
```

This code will create a simple GUI window with the title "Simple GUI". The window will be empty, but you can add widgets to it by calling methods on the `MainWindow` object. For example, to add a button to the window, you would call the `addButton()` method.
