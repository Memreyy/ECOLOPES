# Unveiling the ECOLOPES Project

The **ECOLOPES** Project is a pioneering venture meticulously designed to revolutionize integrated ecosystem architecture. Its focus is creating inclusive living spaces for humans, plants, animals, and associated organisms within urban environments.

**ECOLOPES Concept:** Reimagining architecture, ECOLOPES introduces multi-species living spaces that envelop humans, plants, animals, and microbiota within building envelopes [4] [5].

**Project Goals:** Funded by the European Union, the ECOLOPES Project strives to amplify human-nature interaction in cities. It aims to transform building envelopes into harmonious habitats for various species, fostering regenerative urban ecosystems [3].

**Approach:** ECOLOPES adopts a revolutionary multi-species design approach, challenging traditional anthropocentric views in architecture. It ensures equal consideration for humans, plants, animals, and microbes [10].

**Research Focus:** Assessing human well-being, thermal comfort, and building blocks analysis within these multi-species living spaces, ECOLOPES emphasizes the symbiotic relationship between all inhabitants [6].

**Impact:** By seamlessly integrating nature into urban infrastructure, ECOLOPES promotes ecological balance and ushers in a new era of sustainable architecture, fostering coexistence between humans and the environment.

### Additional Information

To convert a `.ui` file generated by Qt Designer to Python code, use the following command:

```bash
python -m PyQt5.uic.pyuic -x name.ui -o name_design.py
```

Command breakdown:

- `python`: Specifies Python commands execution.
- `-m PyQt5.uic.pyuic`: Runs the `pyuic` module from PyQt5 for converting `.ui` files.
- `-x`: Allows `pyuic` to directly generate an executable Python script.
- `name.ui`: Replace with the Qt Designer `.ui` file name.
- `-o name_design.py`: Specifies the output file for the generated Python code.

Example command:

```bash
python -m PyQt5.uic.pyuic -x mainwindow.ui -o mainwindow_design.py
```
