### The Four Main Sections of the docs Folder

Daniele Procida gave a wonderful PyCon 2017 talk and subsequent blog post about documenting Python projects. He mentions that all projects should have the following four major sections to help you focus your work:

- Tutorials: Lessons that take the reader by the hand through a series of steps to complete a project (or meaningful exercise). Geared towards the user’s learning.
- How-To Guides: Guides that take the reader through the steps required to solve a common problem (problem-oriented recipes).
- References: Explanations that clarify and illuminate a particular topic. Geared towards understanding.
- Explanations: Technical descriptions of the machinery and how to operate it (key classes, functions, APIs, and so forth). Think Encyclopedia article.

The following table shows how all of these sections relates to each other as well as their overall purpose:

|                       | Most Useful When We’re Studying  | Most Useful When We’re Coding |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Practical step        | Tutorials                        | How-To Guides                 |
| Theoretical knowledge | Explanation                      | Reference                     |

In the end, you want to make sure that your users have access to the answers to any questions they may have. By organizing your project in this manner, you’ll be able to answer those questions easily and in a format they’ll be able to navigate quickly.
